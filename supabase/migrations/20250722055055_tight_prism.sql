  # Fix RLS Policies for User Authentication

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing restrictive policies
    - Create permissive policies for demo/development environment
    - Allow anonymous users to read and insert user profiles for authentication
    - Allow authenticated users to manage sessions

  2. Changes Made
    - Enable public access for user_profiles table (development only)
    - Allow anonymous users to create demo users
    - Allow anonymous users to query users for login
    - Maintain session security for authenticated users
