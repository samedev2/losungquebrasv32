  # Fix breakdown_photos RLS policies for photo uploads

  1. Security Updates
    - Add proper INSERT policy for authenticated users on breakdown_photos table
    - Add proper SELECT policy for authenticated users on breakdown_photos table
    - Add proper UPDATE policy for authenticated users on breakdown_photos table
    - Add proper DELETE policy for authenticated users on breakdown_photos table
    - Ensure storage bucket policies allow authenticated users to upload files

  2. Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies that are blocking uploads
    - Create new policies that allow authenticated users full access to breakdown_photos
    - This aligns with the existing policies on other tables in the system

  3. Notes
    - The breakdown_photos table currently has RLS enabled but overly restrictive policies
    - Other tables in the system use "Full access" policies for authenticated users
    - This change maintains security while allowing proper functionality
